\section{Graph Representation}

\subsection{Adjacent List}

For the template parameters, V is the number of vertices, E is the number of
edges.

\lstinputlisting{../include/graph/glist.h}

\subsection{Adjacent Matrix}

For the template parameter, V is the number of vertices.

\lstinputlisting{../include/graph/gmatrix.h}


\section{Shortest Path}

\subsection{Dijkstra Algorithm for Adjacent Matrix Graphs}

This implementation for Dijkstra Algorithm requires the graph which is
represented in adjacent matrix. It's not optimized so in worst case it is
$O(n^2)$.
